# OrderStatisticTree
Java implementation of an order statistic tree - fork of https://github.com/coderodde/OrderStatisticTree 

This fork allows for multiple values in tree say A and B where `A.compareTo(B)==0` but `A<>B`.  For example a count of points, time, etc. for ranking in a leaderboard where there may be ties of non-equal elements
